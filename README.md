## Description of website
This is a website all about me, showcasing my abilities as a Web Developer.

## Purpose, functionality/features
Having worked in marketing for many years, I had to create a website with a UX that was functional and intutive, and a UI that was aesthetically pleasing.

I chose the Google font Lato for it accessability to dyslexic readers, downloading the font family to my files, rather than linking to Google, to prevent issues with the SRI. I also increased the line spacing to 1.6 for better readability.

I added descriptive alt texts to images, including the expression of the photo subjects, where possible.

I wanted to select a clean colour palette, with an eye-catching highlight colour. I decided to try to match the shade of red in my dress.
### Colors used:
![colours](docs/screenshots/ss-colours.png "Colours")
* Raspberry #E63946
* Light green #F1FAEE
* Aqua #A8DADC
* Mid-blue #457B9D
* Dark blue #1D3557

As red text/background can be difficult to read, I only used this colour sparingly. It appears when hovering over a button or selection in the nav menu, as an outline around blog posts, and as a focus outline for site visitors using their keyboard to navigate the site.

The nav menu features at the very top of the screen, and is fixed, so that you can navigate around the site no matter where you've scrolled to. The size of the menu and its fonts increases with the size of the user's screen. For very long pages, such as Terms & Conditions, I included anchors to the top of the page.

Main headings of the page are extra-large and create a block of colour.
