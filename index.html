            <p>My  name is Lydia Cox, and I am studying DevOps with Coder Academy. Having made the decision to make a change of professions, I am reskilling and embarking on my career in IT. Enthusiastic to learn as much as possible about cloud computing, programming and information security, I will undoubtedly be capitalising on my more than 13 yearsâ€™ experience in superannuation.</p>
            <p>Based near Melbourne, Australia, I am a gym junkie and a novice golfer, with a handicap of approximately 1,000.</p>
