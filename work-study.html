                    <h5>October 2011 to May 2021</h5>
                    <p>As Communications Coordinator at REI Super, I was responsible for the development and execution of communications to 30,000 members and 7,000 employers. I also updated website content as necessary using Sitefinity, and monitored social media activity.</p>
                    <p>In short, I had to make superannuation interesting, and I rose to the challenge. I also had to keep the highly confidential member data that had been entrusted to me safe, a responsibility I did not take lightly.</p>

                    <h5>March 2007 to March 2011</h5>
                    <p>The first point of contact for the superannuation fund Trustee office, I was gatekeeper for all incoming communications. I also played the crucial role of IT liason, working with Trustee staff and IT consultants and suppliers to maintain smooth operations within the office.</p>
                    <p>Reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, I managed his diary and travel arrangements, and facilitated Fund Status Reports for the Board of Directors. I also made arrangements for quarterly Board meetings, setting meeting agendas in conjuction with the CEO and producing Board Reports.</p>

                    <h4>Brisbane, Queensland</h4>
                    <h5>February 2007 to January 2008</h5>
                    <p>This was, without a doubt, most varied job I have ever had. I met people from all walks of life, negotiated in high-pressure situations, learned the ins and outs of property management legislation, strata rules and insurance policies. Often on the receving end of or calling with bad news, I had to have thick skin, be able to think on my feet and find creative solutions to pressing problems. This is the hardest job in real estate, but I thrived on the fast-paced nature of the role.</p>

                    <h4>Geelong, Victoria</h4>
                    <h5>September 2004 to July 2006</h5>
                    <p>In this role I created real estate advertisements for three publications, all while adhering to strict styles guides.</p>
                    <p>While the accounts department had a database of customers, we in the advertising department did not. Hand edited letters to customers were time consuming to create and prone to errors, and the company gave us few software resources (we even had to share one computer among five of us - the dark ages!) So I created a database using Microsoft Access and marketing documents using MailMerge in Word. This was all self taught by trial and error - I did not have ready access to tutorials. As a result of my efforts, communications to dozens of customers took minutes instead of days, and my only regret is not calling it Salesforce and making billions of dollars.</p>

                    <p>Did I finish my degree? No. But I had two good reasons. The first was that it turns out I don't want to be a journalist. The second is that I made the life-changing decision to move to Australia. This was undoubtedly the best decision I ever made.</p>
